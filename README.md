# Banking_System_Core
A high-integrity financial ledger engine simulating real-world banking operations accounts, transfers, scheduled payments, account merging, and historical balance tracking.
The Banking System Core is a high-integrity financial ledger engine designed to simulate how real-world banking systems manage money. This project goes beyond basic CRUD operations — it implements actual banking logic including consistent account balances, audit-friendly transaction workflows, scheduled payments, historical balance reconstruction, and account merging.

Built with Java 17 + Spring Boot, this system follows the principles used in large-scale fintech platforms: deterministic state updates, event-driven operations, strict ordering of transactions, and full historical traceability.

Whether you're exploring backend engineering, financial systems, or enterprise-grade design patterns, this project aims to demonstrate how a robust, scalable, transaction-safe banking engine is built from the ground up.
